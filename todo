*  replicate taylor losses
> fourier overfitting
- fourier taylor nulification
> simple, convulational and ft network

----
taylor expansion at begining and ft static at beginning
domain expansion works better when you try to predict formula 
learning rate different answer for taylor and simple
fourier and ft both reach same accuracy compared to previous and ft reaches connclusion faster
ft caputures more value when overfitting
